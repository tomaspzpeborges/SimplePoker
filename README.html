<h1 id="comp1721-coursework-2">COMP1721 Coursework 2</h1>
<p>Everything you need to do in this assignment, aside from editing code, is handled by the Gradle build system. You can run Gradle from the command line or use it from within the IntelliJ IDE if you prefer. If using IntelliJ, please use a recent version of the IDE on your own PC and run the <em>Import Project</em> wizard, specifying the project type as 'Gradle'.</p>
<p><strong>You do not need to install Gradle yourself</strong>, as we've included a 'Gradle wrapper' that will download a compatible version of the tool, along with various library dependencies, if required. <strong>This will be very slow the first time that it runs!</strong></p>
<p>On Linux and macOS, run the wrapper with <code>./gradlew</code>. On Windows, it should be possible to run it with <code>gradlew</code>. The commands below assume the use of Linux or macOS. <strong>Please remember that we are unable to support the use of Windows for the practical work in this module</strong>, and certain aspects of the workflow - such as preparing files for submission - will definitely <em>not</em> work on Windows.</p>
<p>The different coursework artifacts are organised into separate projects. You can list these projects with <code>./gradlew projects</code>. When you start on the assignment, there should be two projects listed: <code>core</code> and <code>stats</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the project name needs to be included when running tasks within a specific project.</p>
<h2 id="basic-full-solutions">Basic &amp; Full Solutions</h2>
<h3 id="class-testing">Class Testing</h3>
<p>You must implement classes <code>Deck</code> and <code>PokerHand</code> in the files <code>Deck.java</code> and <code>PokerHand.java</code> that have already been provided for you in <code>core/src/main/java/comp1721/cwk2</code>. As with Coursework 1, you need to start with stub implementations of these classes in order to compile and run the tests.</p>
<p>To run all the unit tests, recompiling code where necessary, do</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:test</code></pre>
<p>To run only the tests for the basic solution, do</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:test --tests Basic</code></pre>
<p>Substitute <code>Full</code> for <code>Basic</code> in the above command to run only the tests for the full solution.</p>
<p>Tests and their status (PASSED or FAILED) are listed in the terminal. A <strong>test report</strong> is also generated in HTML, containing detailed information about the tests and any failures that have occurred. You can access this by pointing your browser at <code>core/build/reports/tests/test/index.html</code>. We suggest you keep this page open in a browser tab, refreshing it as necessary, so that you always have full information available on test results.</p>
<p>Note that Gradle won't normally rerun tests if they have all passed, unless you've changed something in your code. You can force it to recompile everything and rerun the tests using</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:test --rerun-tasks</code></pre>
<h3 id="style-checking">Style Checking</h3>
<p>To check coding style for the classes in the <code>core</code> project, do</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:style</code></pre>
<p>If there are any style violations, you'll see a count reported in the terminal window. A full report on the violations can be viewed by pointing your browser at <code>core/build/reports/checkstyle/main.html</code>. <strong>Treat this report as a rough guide only</strong>. Warnings will not necessarily lead to the deduction of style marks. Also, note that style checking is not exhaustive and we may still penalise you on style grounds even if no violations are reported here.</p>
<p>As with unit tests, Gradle normally won't rerun the style check unless you change something in your code.</p>
<p>You can check coding style <em>and</em> run tests in one go with</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:check</code></pre>
<h3 id="generating-documentation">Generating Documentation</h3>
<p>To generate HTML documentation from doc comments in the core classes, do</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:javadoc</code></pre>
<p>Then view the documentation by pointing a web browser at <code>core/build/docs/javadoc/index.html</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-pokerstats-application">The <code>PokerStats</code> Application</h3>
<p>You must implement this as a class <code>PokerStats</code>, containing a <code>main</code> method, Put your implementation in the file <code>PokerStats.java</code> provided for you in <code>stats/src/main/java/comp1721/cwk2</code>.</p>
<p>You can check coding style for this application with</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :stats:style</code></pre>
<p>For the basic solution, you can run the application like this:</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :stats:run</code></pre>
<p>For the full solution, the application will require 1 or 2 command line arguments, which can be supplied like this:</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :stats:run --args stats.log
./gradlew :stats:run --args &quot;stats.log 2500&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The first argument is the name of a log file and the optional second argument is the number of trials to be performed. When the latter has has't been supplied by the user, your program should use a default of 1,000. Note that the quotes are necessary when supplying two command line arguments via Gradle.</p>
<p>You can create a redistributable version of the application with</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :stats:distZip</code></pre>
<p>This creates a Zip archive <code>stats.zip</code>, in <code>stats/build/distributions</code>. This Zip archive contains the compiled code for the core class library and application, bundled into a pair of JAR files, plus a shell script and batch file that can be used to run the program on Linux, macOS or Windows.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-task">Advanced Task</h2>
<p>As in Coursework 1, the advanced task involves the use of JavaFX. It should be possible to do this on SoC Linux machines or on your own PC. <a href="README-jfx.html">Please follow the instructions in the <code>README-jfx</code> file</a> to configure JavaFX in the environment that you are using for the work.</p>
<p>The <code>advanced</code> project contains the class <code>FancyCard</code>, which you'll need to use when building your solution. The <code>display</code> and <code>animate</code> projects contain examples of displaying and animating playing cards using JavaFX. You can use these as inspiration for your solution. Run them like so:</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :display:run
./gradlew :animate:run</code></pre>
<p>The only place where you should add any code for the advanced solution is in the <code>game</code> project - specifically the <code>game/src/main/java/comp1721/cwk2</code> directory. You can put whatever you like in here but make sure that the application is launched from the class <code>PokerGame</code> (since this is what the Gradle build file expects).</p>
<p>You should be able to run the application with</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :game:run</code></pre>
<h2 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning Up</h2>
<p>To remove all files generated by the build process across all projects, use</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew clean</code></pre>
<p>You can also clean individual projects - e.g., using</p>
<pre><code>./gradle :stats:clean</code></pre>
